# neutron_burst
A github project containing jupyter notebook tools for understanding neutron burst nucleosynthesis and comparing to presolar grain data. 

The neutron burst is a neutron capture process that lies somewhere between the s and r-processes. This project explores the origin of the isotope's created from this exotic nucleosynthesis process by allowing for your own modifications to the neutron exposure and by varying the initial composition relative to solar.

The following is a description of each of the notebooks:

**numerical_solution.ipynb** demonstrates the solution to the neutron burst by integrating the network equations numerically. It shows how the final abundances in the neutron burst vary with exposure and varying nuclear caption cross sections. You can run the notebook on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge at the end of this paragraph. You will need to sign in with your Google account. If you receive a warning about the authorship of the notebook, you may ignore it by clicking on "Run anyway". Execute the whole notebook by clicking on "Run all" from the "Runtime" menu. You can then change inputs or code in the notebook, as desired.

**analytic_solution.ipynb** showcases the analytic solution and compares it to the numeric solution. You can run the notebook on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge at the end of this paragraph.
