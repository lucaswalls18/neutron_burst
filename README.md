# neutron_burst
A jupyter notebook for computing neutron burst abundances.

The neutron burst is a neutron capture process that lies somewhere between the s and r-processes. This project explores the origin of the isotope's created from this exotic nucleosynthesis process by allowing for your own modifications to the neutron exposure and by varying the initial composition relative to solar. Before exploring this notebook please take note of two things:

1) This project is under development. The initial commit showcases the simple, but effective numerical solution that allows for the exploration of the final abundances of any neutron capture chain provided that the neutron capture cross sections are not greatly different from one another.
2) Any suggestions for improvements and features to add are welcome and can be directed to <lwalls@clemson.edu> or <mbradle@clemson.edu> 

You can run the notebook on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge at the end of this paragraph.  You will need to sign in with your Google account.  If you receive a warning about the authorship of the notebook, you may ignore it by clicking on "Run anyway".  Execute the whole notebook by clicking on "Run all" from the "Runtime" menu.  You can then change inputs or code in the notebook, as desired.

Keep up to date with this repository for future updates including a notebook on the analytic solution to the neutron burst utilizing the solution to the linear, acyclic reaction network. This solution gives insight into features of the abundance curve with increasing exposure and allows for the exploration of final abundances given a distribution of neutron exposures.
